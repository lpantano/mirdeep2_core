This is a copy of files from the original web page: https://www.mdc-berlin.de/8551903/en/

I am NOT an author from the original paper, I will only modify small functions and provide some fixes.

This repository is changing functions to get mirdeep2 working directly with bam files with the goal to get it inside bcbio in the future.

As well, some fixes will be implemented here to get an easy way to deploy and run with compatible files.
