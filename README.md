This is a copy of files from the original web page: https://www.mdc-berlin.de/8551903/en/

This repository is changing some function to get mirdeep2 working with basic files, directly from bam files with the goal to get it inside bcbio in the future.

As well, some fixes will be implemented here to get an easy way to deploy and run with compatible files.
